This repository contains the supporting data, scripts, and files used for molecular dynamics simulations and figure generation related to the following article :
[cite sc_article]


## Repository Structure

### `supp_files/`

This directory contains all the necessary files to reproduce and understand the molecular dynamics simulations:

- **`popc/`**  
  Contains distribution data and PMF (Potential of Mean Force) results for each analog molecule studied.

- **`parameter_files/`**  
  Includes all parameter files used in the molecular dynamics simulations:
  - **`sidechain_toppar`**: Contains force field parameters specific to the analog sidechains.

- **`input_systems/`**  
  Provides the initial system setup for each analog simulation, including PDB and PSF files.

### `figures/`

This directory contains all scripts, data, and output files used to generate the figures presented in the main article and supplementary material.
